# Programming Assignments
All done in Python.

The "official" assignments use a trial of the commercial Graphlab Create package from Turi
(formerly Dato and recently purchased by Apple).  But I also did some of them using scikit-learn so
I could compare and contrast using these two Python machine learning libraries.
